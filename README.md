# Mysterious Organic Automata

So I was trying to create a very simple image, a sort of Pascal's triangle but adding RGB values instead of numbers (see the chromatic-pascal-triangle folder). In the way I got some cool errors (see errors 1, 2 and 3). But the fourth error was different.

Out of nowhere, a very complex, organic and beautiful structure appeared (moa0.png). I did NOT expect that. I was shocked, amazed. I spent the rest of the day playing with the code, but I still can't understand it. I'm leaving the most interesting results. If someone can explain to me what's going on, I'll be really thankful.

I lost the code for moa1, moa2 and moa6. moa0 is just moa3 but smaller.
